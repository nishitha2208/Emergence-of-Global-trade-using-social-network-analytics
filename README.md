# Emergence-of-Global-trade-using-social-network-analytics
Conglomeration of all the analytics and insightful information to understand how the trade network is emerging amongst countries over a span of two decades affected by its Social Network. We have observed that interestingly, the global trade network is getting decentralized and the wealth gap between rich countries and poor countries seems to be wider than ever before. In this project, the goal is to un-veil the reasons behind the huge wealth gap we are facing right now using just the social network to analyze the world-trade-network evolution. Data for 161 countries and their ties with other countries along with the weight of trade has been extracted from Kaggle to perform various network analytics. We were able to get some very insightful take-away while understanding the dynamics of global trade networks and address economic problems using just a few social network Analytic techniques where it seems surprising it was always expected to get such insights by big-data analytics. This project discusses world-trade-network on a global scale and will provide detailed analysis of selected countries individually.
